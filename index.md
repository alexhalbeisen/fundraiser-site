  content: The goal of this fundraiser is to raise awareness of mental health and
    suicide prevention. To provide resources to those struggling, or anyone who can
    lead knowledge to those in need.<br><br>These can be topics that we don't know
    enough about or even make us uncomfortable. But we have to build up our communities
    around accepting mental health problems as a normal issue we face in our lives.
    There are ways of coping and surviving for everyone.

  headline: "<strong>For Tierica Pang</strong>"
  content: December 5th would have been her 26th birthday. She never cared for material
    or extravagant gestures. It was always the little and meaningful things she appreciated
    most. If something supported a greater good, like better for our planet or its
    inhabitants, she'd rather money go there instead. Collectively, these contributions
    lead to a change that can make a difference. <br><br>She was an advocate for being
    kind and forgiving towards yourself. Even if you were having a challenging day,
    she'd encourage you to take it one step at a time. Continue to make those tiny
    strides and accomplish one small goal at a time. It's okay to not tackle everything
    at once. These movements are what get you to where you want in the end.<br><br>I've
    been faced with this personal challenge of honoring her. Unsure where to even
    begin, I have to start somewhere so long as I keep moving. So here is the first
    step in her honor. This is what she would want for the world; continue to help
    those who are struggling. Love yourself and others around you. This is our gift
    to her.<br><br>A memorial has been created with the <strong>American Foundation
    for Suicide Prevention</strong> in her name. Any amount helps in this cause.<br><strong><br></strong><a
