  headline: 'Raising Awareness '
  content: The goal of this fundraiser is to raise awareness of mental health and
    provide aid for suicide prevention. In addition, to spread resources to those
    struggling, or to anyone in a position of help. These can be topics that make
    us uncomfortable. But we have to build up our communities around accepting mental
    health problems as a normal issue we face in our lives.

  headline: "<strong>For Tierica Pang</strong>"
  content: December 5th would have been her birthday. She never cared for material
    or extravagant gestures. It was always the little and meaningful things she appreciated
    most. If something supported a greater good, like better for our planet or its
    inhabitants, she'd rather money go there instead. <br><br>She was an incredibly
    selfless person dedicated to thinking of needs beyond her own. Even if she were
    having a challenging day, she'd still be there to support those around her. <br><br>We
    lost a voice that advocated so openly and passionately for people to recognize
    the effects of mental health on our society. But, with her it doesn't end. For
    others, there is still hope. This is what she would want for the world; fighting
    to help those who are struggling. Love yourself and others around you. Continue
    to be. <br><br>A memorial has been created with the <strong>American Foundation
    for Suicide Prevention</strong> in her name. Any amount helps in this cause.<br><strong><br></strong><a

    will close on the last day of the year.
