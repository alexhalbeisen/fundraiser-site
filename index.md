  headline: "<strong>for tierica</strong>"
  content: December 5th would have been her 26th birthday. She never cared for material
    or extravagant gestures. It was always the little and meaningful things she appreciated
    the most. If something supported a greater good, like better for our planet and
    its inhabitants, she'd rather money go there instead. It's these small contributions
    that had the biggest impact and would make a difference. <br><br>She was an advocate
    for being kind towards yourself. Even if you were having a challenging day, she'd
    encourage you to take it one step at a time. Continue to make those tiny strides
    to accomplish a reachable goal. Overall, these movements together would get you
    to where you wanted in the end.<br><br>I've been faced with this personal challenge
    of honoring her in a way she would be proud of. Unsure where to start, I'll start
    somewhere so long as I keep moving. The first step is to set forth the first year
    of the 'love yourself' fundraiser. <br><br>The goal is to raise awareness of mental
    health and suicide prevention. To provide resources to those struggling, or anyone
    who can lead knowledge to those in need. A memorial has been created with the
    <strong>American Foundation for Suicide Prevention</strong> in her name. Any amount
    helps in this cause. <br><br>The day of, there will be a 5K walk from Shedd Park
    to Downtown Lowell. During these times, it is important we social distance so
    we will be paying attention to local rules regarding COVID19. Also, this event
    depends on weather conditions which will be followed closely prior to the date.
    Even if you feel like you are unable to participate, a donation or educating yourself
    (and others) on these issues is equally a step in the right direction. <br><br>This
    is what she would want for the world; continue to help those who are struggling.
    Love yourself and others around you.

  headline: "<strong>safety </strong>"
  content: As COVID19 is obviously a concern for large gatherings, we want to make
    sure we carry out the walk in a safe manner. Approval from the City of Lowell
    is still needed. For those who are not local and want to join, we will be organizing
    a virtual 5K as well. This also may be the only option if not allowed.
