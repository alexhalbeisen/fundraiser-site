  headline: "<strong>for tierica</strong>"
  content: December 5th would have been her 26th birthday. She never cared for material
    or extravagant gestures. It was always the little and meaningful things she appreciated
    the most. If something supported a greater good, like better for our planet and
    its inhabitants, she'd rather money go there instead. It's these small contributions
    that had the biggest impact and would make a difference. <br><br>She was an advocate
    for being kind towards yourself. Even if you were having a challenging day, she'd
    encourage you to take it one step at a time. Continue to make those tiny strides
    to accomplish a reachable goal. Overall, these movements together would get you
    to where you wanted in the end.<br><br>I've been faced with this personal challenge
    of honoring her in a way she would be proud of. Unsure where to start, I'll start
    somewhere so long as I keep moving. The first step is to set forth the first year
    of the 'love yourself' fundraiser. <br><br>The goal is to raise awareness of mental
    health and suicide prevention. To provide resources to those struggling, or anyone
    who can lead knowledge to those in need. A memorial has been created with the
    <strong>American Foundation for Suicide Prevention</strong> in her name. Any amount
    helps in this cause. <br><br>This is what she would want for the world; continue
    to help those who are struggling. Love yourself and others around you.
