  content: 'Honoring the memory of Tierica is something that has challenged me for
    a while. I have been unsure the best way to appreciate those years I was fortunate
    to know her. December 5th would have been her 26th birthday. She never liked big
    gestures. It was always the small things that had the most impact. Likewise, she
    encouraged me to take small steps to reach those bigger goals. On this day, I
    would like to start the first year of the ''love yourself'' fundraiser. <br><br>The
    goal is to spread awareness of mental health and suicide prevention in her honor.
    Unlike most fundraisers, I will not collect payment. I ask you to pledge a donation
    to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in the name of Tierica. Any
    amount helps in this cause. <br><br>The day of, I am planning on a 5K walk from
    Shedd Park to Downtown Lowell. During these times, it is important we social distance. '
