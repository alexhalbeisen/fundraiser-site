  headline: "<strong>for tierica</strong>"
  content: December 5th would have been her 26th birthday. She never cared for material
    or extravagant gestures. It was always the little and meaningful things she appreciated
    the most. If something supported a greater good, like better for our planet and
    its inhabitants, she'd rather money go there instead. <br><br>It's these small
    contributions that she believed would make a bigger difference. Likewise, she
    was an advocate for being kind towards yourself. Even if you were having a challenging
    day, she'd encourage you to take it one step at a time. Make those tiny strides
    in life to succeed, those movements will get you there in the end.<br><br>Recently,
    I have been faced with a personal challenge of honoring her in a way she would
    be proud of. So, this step is to set forth the first year of the 'love yourself'
    fundraiser. <br><br>The goal is to raise awareness of mental health and suicide
    prevention in her honor. A memorial has been created with the <strong>American
    Foundation for Suicide Prevention</strong> in her name. Any amount helps in this
    cause. Together, these small gestures can make a difference in creating a better
    world. The link to donate is above.<br><br>The day of, there will be a 5K walk
    from Shedd Park to Downtown Lowell. During these times, it is important we social
    distance. Also, this event depends on weather conditions which will be followed
    closely prior to the date. Even if you feel like you are unable to participate,
    a donation or educating yourself (and others) on these issues is equally a step
    in the right direction. <br><br>This is what she would want for the world; continue
    to help those who are struggling. Remember to love yourself and others around
    you.
