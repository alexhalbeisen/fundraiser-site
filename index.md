  content: 'December 5th would have been her 26th birthday. She never cared for material
    or extravagant gestures. It was always the little and meaningful things she appreciated
    the most. If something supported a greater good, like better for our planet and
    its inhabitants, she''d rather money go there instead. <br><br>It''s these small
    contributions that she believed would make a bigger difference. Likewise, she
    was an advocate for being kind towards yourself. Even if you were having a challenging
    day, she''d encourage you to take it one step at a time. Make those tiny strides
    in life to succeed, those movements will get you there in the end.<br><br>Recently,
    I have been faced with a personal challenge of honoring her in a way she would
    be proud of. So, my next step is setting forth the first year of the ''love yourself''
    fundraiser. <br><br>The goal is to raise awareness of mental health and suicide
    prevention in her honor. Unlike most fundraisers, I will not seek payment. I ask
    you to pledge a donation to the listed charities in her name. Any amount helps
    in this cause. Together, these small gestures can make a difference in creating
    a better world.<br><br>The day of, there will be a 5K walk from Shedd Park to
    Downtown Lowell. During these times, it is important we social distance and anyone
    who wishes to organize their own way in solidarity is free to do so. Whether it
    be a 5K on their own, making a donation, showing self love - making that step
    is the spirit of the cause. <br><br>This is what she would want for the world;
    to show compassion for yourself and others. '
