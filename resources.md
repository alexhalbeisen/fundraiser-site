  content: <p>Therapy is important even for those who don't struggle with mental health
    issues. There shouldn't be any stigma against seeing one. But for some, the main
    obstacle is cost. </p><p>Here are some ways to help:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>Reach
    out or go to your health insurance company to find what therapists are in your
    network or what services are covered</p></li><li><p>Visit <a href="https://www.211.org/"
    title="211">211.org</a> or contact SAMHSA’s National Helpline at 800-662-HELP
    to locate a community mental health center local to you</p></li><li><p>Visit the
    <a href="https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/" title="HRSA">Health Resources and
    Service Administration</a> to locate a community health center. These are able
    to provide free services to those who meet income requirements</p></li><li><p>Look
    to see if a therapist works based on a sliding scale, which is based on your ability
    to pay</p></li><li><p>Contact local universities or medical schools to see if
    they have psychotherapy/psychiatry training clinics that offer discounted sessions</p></li><li><p>If
    you are a student, see if they provide mental health services</p></li><li><p>If
    you are employed, many workplaces often have employee assistance programs (EAP)
    that provide a number of free sessions</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>Even if you
    feel therapy is out of reach, it can't hurt to reach out. Many will even offer
    a free consultation just to see if they're a right fit for you. There are many
    sites to discover a therapy close to you. Here are some places to start looking!</p><p></p><blockquote><ul><li><p><a
